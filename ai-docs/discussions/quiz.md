## QUIZ Open decisions

1. **Session size:** 10 is the default. Should this be configurable (5 / 10 / 20) in the idle/picker state? Probably yes once the feature is live. Leave hardcoded at 10 for the initial build.

2. **Quiz direction:** Fill-in-the-blank and type-the-answer always ask the user to produce Norwegian. Multiple choice could go either direction. The initial build does MC in Norwegian→English (easier, good warm-up). Reverse (English→Norwegian MC) can be a toggle later.

3. **Auto-advance on correct:** After a correct MC answer, auto-advance after 1.5 seconds (highlight green, show example briefly). On incorrect, stay on reveal until Next is tapped. This feels responsive without being jarring. Disable auto-advance if the user has tapped "Slow down" in Profile preferences (future).

4. **`easy` override:** After revealing a correct answer, show a small "Mark as easy" button to issue an `easy` rating instead of `good`. This is a one-tap override for words the user finds trivial. Worth including in the initial build.

5. **C1/C2 in distractor pool:** The current plan loads A1–B2 for the distractor pool. C1/C2 data is available but adds loading weight. Omit from the initial build; add later if B2+ quiz users request it.
