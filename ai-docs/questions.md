# Questions

I have added the path, /Users/shinichiokada/Svelte to Filesystem so you should be able to access /Users/shinichiokada/Svelte/svelte-languages/norskeord.

I have data-rules/vocab-and-uttrykk.md for your information.

==========
I was working on ai-docs/implementation/c-uttrykk-addition.md. Just about to start Phase 2. The following is from a previous session. Due to session limit, you didn't write the result. The git status shows modified: draft/c/vocab-uttrykk/extract-uttrykk-c.json.



ME: Let's start c-uttrykk-addition.md Phase 2.

CLAUDE: Let me copy the production uttrykk files (and vocab-c.json, for the vocab-bucket check later) to run the comparison.17 exact matches found. Let me also run a fuzzy pass (content-word overlap) to catch idioms that exist under different wording — these need manual judgment rather than auto-drop.Good — now let me evaluate the fuzzy hits individually (token overlap alone isn't reliable) before deciding what to drop.Confirmed — both are genuine duplicates already in `uttrykk-c.json` (one is just singular/plural wording). The third fuzzy hit, `ikke ha rent mel i posen` vs. B2's `ha rent mel i posen`, is the same idiom but **opposite polarity** (negated = "has something to hide" vs. affirmative = "has a clean conscience") — that's a judgment call, not an automatic drop, so I'm flagging it rather than deciding it for you.Now let's write the deduplicated file back to the project.

==================

I have src/lib/grammar directory for the current /grammar page.

The draft/c/grammar/grammatikk.md explaining grammar for Nivå C. The substantiv.md and ubestemt-artikkel.md have questions for substantiv and ubestemt artikkel grammar points. You can find answers in answers.md.
I'd like to create Nivå C grammar questions by using at least one Nivå C vocab from src/lib/data/vocab-c.json and uttrykk-c.json.

I don't need a lot of questions as the substantiv.md and ubestemt-artikkel.md but a good number of questions to cover as many as possible.

1. The questions are from a textbook. Can I use some of them?
2. How many questions are appropiate?
Do you have any more suggestions?
Do not create questions yet. Let's discuss first.

I will be adding more files which are scanned froma textbook in draft/c directory and you can find topics in draft/c/grammar/innhold.md.

svelte mcp server is running.

You can find db schema in supabase/current-schema.sql, current-functions.sql and current-cron-push-notification.sql. You can find all the db migration files in supabase/migrations directory.

No long paragraphs, academic-style explanations, and walls of text. Users on a learning app want quick, scannable answers, not essays.

You should be able to use Edit_File. Use Edit_File when you are modifying a large file.
Please do not use Write_file, it takes time. Instead can you write a script to update file(s) rather than rewrite whole file(s)? I can run the script locally and in that way, the session limit won't be over-used.

The Filesystem tool can read it but str_replace can't find it. You need to read it fully and rewrite it. In this case, if the file is big and the rewrite is just adding lines or simple replacement, please output it with instruction or create a downloadable file or write Python or mjs script so that I can do it. Because your Write File operation has to rewrite whole file and it takes time to complete.

- http://localhost:5173/norskproven has A2 and B1. I think I need to add B2 as well.
- For mobile, bottom navigation can be used?
- Mobile check
- How about Start free button rather than login?
- Grammtikk section for B2/C1
  This is different from Quiz.
  Quiz has one question by one question. For grammer questions, I'd like to show all the questions at once and user type or select answers.

- I also want to order src/lib/vocab-b2.json according to category field and merge vocab-b2-new.json to vocab-b2.json file according to category field.

## Vocab AI conversion

6. Separate one word and expression which are multiple words.
7. If a norsk word has the following (adj.), (v1), (ureg.), (adv.), (v1, v2), fill up `part` field with `adjective`, `verb`, `verb`, `adverb`, `verb` and remove (adj.), (v1), (ureg.), (adv.), (v1, v2) from a word. And if it is a verb, add `å ` in front of verb in `norsk` field. e.g. `å komme`.
8. Fill up lemma with a dictionary form of `norsk` field with out `(en)`, `(et)`, `(en/ei)` or `å`, etc. Only one word if it is not a expression (more than one word).
