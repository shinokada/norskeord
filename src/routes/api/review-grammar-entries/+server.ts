/**
 * POST /api/review-grammar-entries
 *
 * Fix 3 (ai-docs/implementation/due-only-review-update.md) — the grammar
 * counterpart to POST /api/review-entries (due-only.md Step 1). Resolves a
 * list of grammar question ids (+ the CEFR level each one belongs to) back
 * into full GrammarQuestion objects, without shipping an entire level's
 * grammar JSON to the client just to filter it. Used by /review/grammar:
 * the client already knows which ids are due (from the grammar progress
 * map — Plus via Supabase, free/guest via localStorage) but only has
 * id/level/topic on each CardProgress row, not the full question (prompt,
 * sentence, options, answer, ...).
 *
 * No auth check — this returns the same public grammar data every
 * /grammar/[topic] page already serves, just addressed by id instead of
 * by topic.
