/**
 * POST /api/review-entries
 *
 * ai-docs/implementation/due-only.md — Step 1.
 * ai-docs/implementation/permanent-structural-fix.md — Phase 3.
 *
 * Resolves a list of due ids back into full VocabEntry objects, without
 * shipping an entire level's JSON to the client just to filter it. Used by
 * the /review due-only session: the client already knows *which* ids are
 * due (from getDueItems() in progress.ts — Plus via Supabase, free/guest
 * via localStorage) but only has the id itself, not the full entry (norsk,
 * translations, examples, ...) or even a trustworthy level/category for it.
 *
 * As of Phase 3, level/category/vocab-vs-uttrykk scoping happens here too,
 * server-side, instead of client-side in getDueItems() — and it's resolved
 * *live* via content-lookup.ts's `resolveEntry()` rather than trusted from
 * any client-supplied level. That matters: the client's only source for an
 * id's level/category is the stored `CardProgress` snapshot, which goes
 * stale the instant an entry's level/category/type changes in content
 * without the card being reviewed again (the exact bug the whole plan doc
 * fixes for stats.ts). Resolving live here means a due card for an id
 * that's since moved is still found under its *current* location, with no
 * re-review needed — and doing it server-side, rather than importing
 * content-lookup.ts into progress.ts, keeps that full id→location map out
 * of the client bundle (see the plan doc's Performance notes).
 *
 * No auth check — this returns the same public vocab/uttrykk data every
 * `/{level}/{category}` page already serves, just addressed by id instead
 * of by category.
