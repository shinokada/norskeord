## vocab-xx.json entry rules

### `norsk` field

The display form shown to learners.

| `part`                   | Format                                                                      | Example                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `noun`                   | dictionary form + gender in parentheses                                     | `hus (et)`                      |
| `noun` (variable gender) | dictionary form + `(en/ei)` (both accepted, e.g. `m/f` source dictionaries) | `elv (en/ei)`                   |
| `noun` (plural card)     | plural form + `(pl.)` or `(b.pl.)` in parentheses                           | `bøker (pl.)`, `bøkene (b.pl.)` |
| `noun` (indeclinable)    | dictionary form + `(ubøy.)` in parentheses                                  | `fjor (ubøy.)`                  |
| `verb`                   | infinitive with `å`                                                         | `å få`                          |
| `adjective`              | base (masculine singular) form                                              | `glad`                          |
| `adverb`                 | uninflected form                                                            | `i dag`                         |
| `conjunction`            | uninflected form                                                            | `fordi`                         |
| `preposition`            | uninflected form                                                            | `ved siden av`                  |
| `pronoun`                | base form                                                                   | `jeg`                           |
| `numeral`                | base form                                                                   | `én`                            |
| `interjection`           | base form                                                                   | `hei`                           |
| `phrase`                 | the fixed multi-word form                                                   | `biologisk mangfold`            |

### `lemma` field

Always the canonical form (lemma) of the lexical item — no gender markers, no `å` prefix, no inflection. This applies whether the lexical item is one word or several (e.g. a multi-word verb or preposition still has a lemma). Used for FSRS lookup and deduplication.

| `part`                                                                            | Format                      | Example              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `noun`                                                                            | bare noun, no gender        | `hus`                |
| `verb`                                                                            | infinitive without `å`      | `få`                 |
| `adjective`                                                                       | base form (same as `norsk`) | `glad`               |
| `adverb` / `conjunction` / `preposition` / `pronoun` / `numeral` / `interjection` | same as `norsk`             | `fordi`              |
| `phrase`                                                                          | same as `norsk`             | `biologisk mangfold` |

### Plural-form noun cards

Irregular or otherwise learning-worthy plurals (`bok` → `bøker`, `barn` → `barn`, `mann` → `menn`) can get their own `noun` vocab card in addition to the singular dictionary-form card. This is optional — only add a plural card when the plural is irregular enough to be worth drilling separately.

- `norsk` — the plural form + a plural marker in parentheses, in place of the gender marker:
  - `(pl.)` — ubestemt flertall, e.g. `bøker (pl.)`
  - `(b.pl.)` — bestemt flertall, e.g. `bøkene (b.pl.)`
- `lemma` — always the bare **singular** dictionary form, same as the base noun's lemma (e.g. `bok`, not `bøker`). This keeps FSRS lookup/dedup anchored to the base word even though the card teaches the plural.
- `id` / `category` / `level` — assigned normally like any other noun entry.

Why not `(u.pl.)`: ubestemt flertall is the unmarked/default plural, so bare `(pl.)` matches standard Norwegian dictionary shorthand (Bokmålsordboka etc. use `pl.` and `best. pl.`). Only bestemt flertall needs an explicit flag.

### Indeclinable noun cards

A small number of Norwegian nouns are genuinely `ubøyelig` (indeclinable) — no gender article, no plural, no bestemt form. `fjor` is the classic example (only ever appears as `i fjor`, `i forfjor`); dictionaries like NAOB and Bokmålsordboka label these explicitly rather than assigning them a gender.

For these, use `(ubøy.)` in place of the gender marker:

```
"norsk": "fjor (ubøy.)",
"lemma": "fjor",
"part": "noun"
```

Don't reach for this marker just because a noun happens to only show up in one fixed phrase in your example sentence — check a dictionary (NAOB/Bokmålsordboka) first and only use `(ubøy.)` when it's actually listed as `ubøyelig`. If the word is more of a fixed multi-word chunk than a single indeclinable noun, it may belong in `uttrykk` instead (see below).

### `part` values

`noun` · `verb` · `adjective` · `adverb` · `conjunction` · `preposition` · `pronoun` · `numeral` · `interjection` · `phrase`

Most multi-word entries keep the `part` of their grammatical head, not `phrase`:

- Multi-word verbs (reflexive, particle) remain `verb` — e.g. `kle på seg`, `slå av`.
- Multi-word prepositions remain `preposition` — e.g. `ved siden av`, `i stedet for`.
- Multi-word noun phrases that name a concept remain `noun` — e.g. `kunstig intelligens`, `biologisk mangfold`.

Use `phrase` only when the entry has **no single grammatical head** — greetings, idioms, discourse markers, and other fixed expressions. In practice, most `phrase`-part entries belong in `uttrykk-xx.json` rather than `vocab-xx.json`; see the decision rule below.

| lemma              | part                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| kle på seg         | verb                 |
| slå av             | verb                 |
| ved siden av       | preposition          |
| biologisk mangfold | noun                 |
| i går              | phrase _(→ uttrykk)_ |
| ha det bra         | phrase _(→ uttrykk)_ |

### ID format

`w-{NNNNNN}` where NNNNNN is a zero-padded 6-digit number, **one shared sequence global across both vocab and uttrykk, and across all levels of each.** Neither `category`, `level`, nor type (vocab vs. uttrykk) is part of the id — all three live only in their own fields (`category`/`part` distinguish vocab from uttrykk), so recategorizing, reclassifying (CEFR level), or moving an entry between vocab and uttrykk is a pure data edit with no id implication.

Example: `w-000001`

Vocab and uttrykk ids are drawn from the same counter and are otherwise indistinguishable by shape — which file an entry lives in, and its `category`/`part` fields, are the only source of truth for its type.

### `note` field (optional)

Free-text usage note — supplementary context that doesn't belong in `definition`. `definition` is a monolingual Norwegian dictionary-style definition (B1+); `note` is looser: register/slang flags, related word-family members, a usage caveat, or a secondary sense. Written in whichever language is clearest (usually Norwegian, since it's typically sourced from Norwegian teaching material).

Example:

```
"note": "Børst er et slangord som brukes av dem som drikker (for) mye selv."
```

### `verb_type` field (optional, `verb` entries only)

Conjugation class, sourced from dictionary/textbook annotations like `(v1)`, `(v2)`, `(v3)`, `(ureg.)`. Value is one of `v1` | `v2` | `v3` | `ureg`, or a comma-separated combination when a source lists more than one accepted class, e.g. `"v1, v2"`.

Example:

```
"norsk": "å subbe",
"part": "verb",
"verb_type": "v1"
```

## Vocab vs Uttrykk

The vocab/uttrykk split is based on **lexical unit-hood**, not on whether the meaning is compositional. Compositionality is a bad test — `i går` ("in yesterday") is fully compositional but still belongs in uttrykk, while `kle på seg` is arguably just as compositional but is an ordinary conjugatable verb. So instead of asking "is the meaning compositional?", ask whether the entry **functions as a dictionary lemma**.

### Vocab (`vocab-xx.json`)

Use **vocab** for lexical items (lemmas). A lexical item may consist of one or more words if it functions as a single dictionary unit — learners inflect/conjugate it and use it productively in sentences like any other word.

This includes:

- nouns (including lexical noun phrases that name a concept)
- verbs, including reflexive verbs and particle verbs
- adjectives
- adverbs
- prepositions (including multi-word prepositions)
- conjunctions
- pronouns
- numerals
- interjections

Examples:

```
hus
være
kle på seg
føle seg
slå av
snakke med
ved siden av
kunstig intelligens
biologisk mangfold
```

This also covers ordinary verb + preposition collocations where the object slot is freely swappable — the preposition is fixed but the verb is the productive head, so the whole thing inflects/conjugates like any other verb. The test is the same as above: can a learner freely substitute the object and conjugate the verb across tenses?

```
sørge for
ta hensyn til
minne om
ha godt av
ta tak i
```

A fixed complement does not disqualify a verb phrase. Literal, non-figurative verb frames — a copula or light verb (`være`, `bli`, `stå`, `få`, `ta`) plus a fixed adjective or prepositional complement — are vocab verbs when the meaning follows from the words (or is a conventionalized, non-figurative frame) and the verb conjugates normally:

```
være i stand til
være i ferd med
stå i fare for
bli kvitt
bli klar over
```

What keeps a verb-initial entry out of vocab is not the shape of its complement but that the phrase is a **figurative idiom** — see "Figurative idioms and proverbs" under Uttrykk below.

> Amended 2026-09-19: an earlier version sent verb + fixed complement that isn't an "ordinary grammatical object" (e.g. `være skyld i`) to uttrykk. That test could not separate `ta hensyn til` (vocab) from `ta vare på` (uttrykk), so it was dropped in favour of the idiom test. Entries already classified under the old test (e.g. `ta vare på`, `ha lyst til`) are not bulk-reclassified; the amended rule applies to new decisions and to entries reviewed from now on.

The same test applies when the swappable slot is an infinitive rather than a noun phrase: a finite verb + fixed complementizer + infinitive construction is vocab, not uttrykk, as long as the finite verb conjugates normally and the infinitive slot is freely swappable.

```
komme til å
ha lyst til å
ha tid til å
få lov til å
```

This only applies when the complementizer is more than the bare infinitive marker `å` — i.e. a fixed element like `til å` that carries real idiomatic/grammaticalized weight (future sense, desire, permission, etc.), not ordinary infinitive-complement syntax. Plain verb + `å` + infinitive (`begynne å`, `prøve å`, `ønske å`, `håpe å`) is fully productive grammar — almost any verb can take a bare infinitival complement this way — so it doesn't qualify as a vocab lemma on its own; require evidence the _whole sequence_ is lexicalized (a fixed dictionary-citable unit), not just that the pattern is swappable.

See also `ha lyst til` under uttrykk below: without the infinitive it's a fixed conversational fragment (uttrykk), but `ha lyst til å` + infinitive is the grammaticalized "feel like doing" construction (vocab) — same core words, different construction, both classifications correct.

### Uttrykk (`uttrykk-xx.json`)

Use **uttrykk** for fixed expressions that learners memorize as complete chunks rather than as ordinary lexical items — the entry doesn't have a single grammatical head, and learners don't productively inflect or recombine its parts.

This includes:

- greetings
- conversational formulas
- idioms
- proverbs
- discourse markers
- sentence fragments
- fixed time expressions
- fixed prepositional/adverbial expressions that read as a formula rather than ordinary grammar

Examples:

```
ha det bra
god morgen
vær så snill
i går
i morgen
for en stund siden
på den andre siden
etter min mening
ta vare på
ha lyst til
slå seg til ro
alt i alt
det vil si
forutsatt at
med utgangspunkt i
i lys av
```

### Figurative idioms and proverbs (the core of uttrykk)

The clearest uttrykk are **figurative idioms and proverbs**: the meaning cannot be derived from the words even if the learner knows every word, and the expression is used to characterize a particular situation, person or state.

```
som fisken i vannet
ha is i magen
ha et hjerte av gull
ligge i luften
sveve i skyene
ha lopper i blodet
vise en kald skulder
holde hodet over vann
```

Test: does the expression have a figurative meaning tied to a situation, one that a literal paraphrase would not convey (`ha is i magen` = stay calm under pressure)? If yes → uttrykk, even when it starts with a conjugating verb. `være i stand til` or `bli kvitt` fail this test — their meaning is literal or conventional, so they are vocab verbs (see above).

Uttrykk therefore holds two kinds of entry:

1. **Figurative idioms and proverbs** (above) — non-literal, situation-bound.
2. **Head-less formulas** — greetings, conversational formulas, discourse markers, fixed time expressions and fixed prepositional/adverbial chunks (`god morgen`, `alt i alt`, `i går`). These are not figurative, but they have no single grammatical head, so they are not lemmas either.

### `norsk` / `lemma` fields

Same as vocab: `norsk` is the display form, `lemma` is the canonical/dictionary form used for dedup. For uttrykk, both fields are normally identical — the whole fixed chunk, in its citation form — except for the optional `å` described below.

**Verb-initial uttrykk: `å` in `norsk` is optional; `lemma` is always bare.** Either display form is accepted:

| `norsk` (either form is fine)                 | `lemma` (always bare, no `å`) |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `ta vare på` / `å ta vare på`                 | `ta vare på`                  |
| `ha lyst til` / `å ha lyst til`               | `ha lyst til`                  |
| `bli oppfordret til` / `å bli oppfordret til` | `bli oppfordret til`           |

Prefer the bare form for idioms and proverbs cited the way a dictionary would (`ha is i magen`); the `å` form is fine for entries that read naturally as an infinitive phrase (`å ta buss`). Don't normalise existing entries in either direction just for consistency. But never leave `å` in `lemma`: it is used for dedup and FSRS lookup and must match how vocab lemmas are written. When comparing an uttrykk entry against vocab (duplicate checks), ignore a leading `å` on both sides.

> Amended 2026-09-20: an earlier version required the bare form (no `å`) in uttrykk `norsk`. A scan showed `å` in 749 of 1,780 uttrykk entries (`uttrykk-c` 585/916, `-b2` 73/418, `-b1` 63/183, `-a2` 23/156, `-a1` 5/107), so the requirement was dropped in favour of accepting both. `lemma` stays strict. Existing uttrykk entries whose `lemma` still carries `å` (e.g. `w-007966`) are a known cleanup item, see `ai-docs/implementation/reclassification-follow-up.md` §7.

### Decision rule

When deciding between vocab and uttrykk, ask, in order:

1. **Is this a figurative idiom or proverb** — non-literal meaning, tied to a situation? → **uttrykk**, even if it starts with a conjugating verb.
2. **Does this function as a lexical item** (a noun, verb, adjective, preposition, etc., including literal verb + fixed complement frames) that learners inflect/conjugate and recombine normally? → **vocab**.
3. **Is this primarily a fixed chunk** used in communication, with no single grammatical head (greeting, formula, discourse marker, time expression)? → **uttrykk**.

This is easier to apply consistently than asking whether the meaning is compositional, and it resolves the recurring edge cases (reflexive/particle verbs, multi-word prepositions) in favor of `vocab`, while keeping genuine formulas, idioms, and time expressions in `uttrykk`.

### Neither vocab nor uttrykk: productive copula + adjective

`bli`/`være` + a predicative adjective (`bli forelsket`, `bli sulten`, `være glad`) is fully productive Norwegian grammar, not a fixed lexical unit — any adjective can fill the slot. Don't create a standalone card for the combination; make sure the adjective itself has a vocab entry and let `bli`/`være` stand as their own verb entries.

Exception: if the combination has drifted to a non-compositional idiomatic meaning beyond "become/be + adjective," it may warrant its own `uttrykk` entry.

### Collocation entries coexist with their head word (not duplicates)

This app is not a dictionary — the goal is to show learners as many useful
collocation examples as possible, not to minimize the entry count per
lexical item. A verb (or noun/adjective) having its own bare vocab entry
does **not** make a separate collocation entry built on that same head word
a duplicate.

Example: `tåle` (a standalone verb entry, "to tolerate") and `tåle kulde`
("to handle cold weather well") are both legitimate, separate vocab
entries. So are `avlegge en visitt` and `avlegge et besøk` — two different
collocations that happen to mean the same thing ("to pay a visit") — kept
as synonym variants so learners see the range of phrasing, not merged into
one.

**`lemma` exception for these entries:** normally `lemma` is the canonical
dictionary form, shared for dedup/FSRS lookup (see above). A collocation
entry is the exception — its `lemma` stays the full phrase (same as
`norsk`, minus the verb's `å` prefix where applicable), **not** reduced to
the bare head word's canonical form. This keeps the collocation card
distinct from the head word's own card in FSRS/dedup rather than colliding
with it. Only single-word lexical items (verb, noun, adjective, etc.) use
the reduced canonical `lemma`; anything multi-word keeps `lemma` = `norsk`
(minus `å`), whether or not a bare version of its head word also exists
elsewhere.

**What's still a real duplicate, worth deleting:** two entries with the
_identical_ `norsk`/`lemma` text (a copy-paste accident), not two different
phrasings or a phrase vs. its head word. `find_dupes.py`'s cross-file/
within-file duplicate sections catch exact-text repeats; its "normalized
duplicates" section will keep surfacing head-word/collocation pairs like
`tåle` vs `tåle kulde` — that's expected noise under this policy, not
something to action.
